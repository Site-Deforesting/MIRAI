          <p><br /></p>
          <p>For centuries, libraries have been the guardians of human knowledge. These venerable institutions collected information in print and manuscript formats and made it accessible by providing tools (e.g., card catalogues) for searching and locating information. In the past few decades, the function of these institutions has changed dramatically. The Internet has become the primary source of information. With the aid of web-based search engines, such as Google, anyone with an Internet connection can easily locate and search large amounts of textual information. Text-based information retrieval has permeated every aspect of our lives.</p>
          <p>A comparable shift in the accessibility of musical information has yet to take place. Scores and audio
            remain the primary means of transmitting musical information. However, neither of these forms is directly searchable. Scores can be searched once they have been converted to a computer-readable format, but the technology and resources required for the conversion are not readily available. Even if scores were widely available in a computer-readable format, we lack the tools to search them. The search problem is even more complex for audio. Despite over a decade of research in music information retrieval, the question of how to search audio files remains a difficult and, as of yet, only partially solved problem.
          </p>
          <p>Although the computer-aided study of music information has a long history, few projects have resulted in tools and practices that can be integrated horizontally across different research programs. Until recently, little music was available in computer-searchable formats and the technology for converting images of musical scores into such a format (Optical Musical Recognition [OMR]) was not reliable enough. Additionally, the computer-aided study of music information has lacked a flagship research program, central objectives, and a view of the “bigger picture.”</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <h2 id="ii-innovation-and-complementarity-in-the-research-axes">II. Innovation and Complementarity in the Research Axes</h2>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>There are two main research axes in this program: <strong>Content</strong> and <strong>Searching &amp; Analysis</strong>. The Content axis collects and organizes music-related documents in various formats (e.g., scores, audio, and biographical information about composers) so that users can find what they are looking for easily and efficiently. It encompasses projects concerning the improvement of OMR technology (Burgoyne et al. 2009, 2008, 2007a; Charalampos et al. 2014; Fujinaga 2004; Hankinson 2014; Hankinson et al. 2012a, 2010), metadata management (Angeles et al. 2010), biographical data acquisition (prosopography) (Fujinaga 2014, Weiss et al. 2010), and audio feature extraction (McKay et al. 2006a; McEnnis et al. 2006a). Until now, the only OMR technology available was proprietary “black box” software that cannot be improved or adjusted for different types of notation. Our OMR software is open-source and can be trained to work on different types of notation.</p>
          <p>The Searching &amp; Analysis axis creates tools and techniques for searching and analyzing the information collected from the Content axis. From audio sources, we are creating tools for automatic genre classification (McKay et al. 2010b, 2009a, 2009b, 2006c, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c, 2004), harmonic analysis (Burgoyne et al. 2013, 2011, 2007b), performance analysis (Devaney et al. 2011a, 2011b, 2011c), and timbre recognition (Fujinaga et al. 2000). From scores in symbolic notation we are developing tools for searching and analyzing melody, harmony, counterpoint, and structure (Cumming et al. 2015a; Fujinaga et al. 2013). From text documents about music we are developing ways to link data that will reveal new connections among musicians, composers, patrons, places, and institutions.</p>
          <p>Both axes examine how users interact with digital music and continually improve the tools we have developed (Hankinson et al. 2012b, 2012c, 2009, Burlet et al. 2012). Figure 1 shows the overall structure with examples of research projects under each axis.</p>
          <p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/Structure_of_MIRAI.png" alt="" /></p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>The two research axes are independent but complementary. Content that is not searchable in intelligent ways is not useful. Search and analysis algorithms require content to work on. Work can proceed on the two axes independently, but ultimately it is the combination that makes our research program valuable. The “User Interface” box in Figure 1 points to a feature of our program that applies to both axes: tools that are easy to use have the potential for broad impact. With our complementary research axes, the MIRAI team is building efficient and user-friendly tools to accommodate large-scale distributed processing. With these tools, libraries and archives anywhere in the world will be able to process their music collections and make them available to wider audiences for study, performance, and appreciation.</p>

          <h2 id="iii-the-simssa-team">III. The SIMSSA Team</h2>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>We are a <a href="https://simssa.ca/people">diverse team</a> dedicated to accomplishing this mission. SIMSSA includes music scholars, performers, librarians, and music technologists, working to create new tools for research and analysis of the collections of our partner museums, research libraries, and universities. Document processing and OMR correction for this collection will be carried out by musicians, students, and scholars around the world.</p>
